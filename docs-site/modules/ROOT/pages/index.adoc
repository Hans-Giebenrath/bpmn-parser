= Welcome!

== An Introductory Example

Here you see what the tool is all about. The following image is auto-generated, using only the
text which comes after it and another tool called link:https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-to-image[bpmn-to-image].

You likely see some wonky things (if I have not fixed them, yet), but you should get an impression
of what this tool wants to become. Some things will also stay wonky for some definition of wonky, as
some things are simply subjective and I try to do what is reasonable within the bounds of the layout
algorithm.

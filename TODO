* D1.1, page 53 figure 12 subprocess P5, is a good diagram that should be layoutable now.
* Documentation.
* Document infallability of the crate: The crate is meant to be used with catch_unwind: `assert`s are sprinkled throughout the codebase, `.unwrap()`s and index accesses are used everywhere (they are kind-of like assumptions). But the logic is complicated and I am 100% there are remaining hidden logic bugs. (well, right now it is just a binary, so one gets failure isolation "for free", but if I ever make this into a crate, then `catch_unwind`)
* In the crossing minimization, make a tiny factor to favor gateway branch orderings as they were specified in the file, ie. on `NodeId`.
* fix the doc/test/build.sh to use Make/parallel (or Rust threadpools) so we can have bounded parallelism.
* Also handle JXI routing: swap up-down order to down-up order (or vice versa), or if it is unavoidable then move JXIs the the IXI handling. (JXI is an edge cross where only one side (top or bottom) has the same y coordinate)
* Add more checks for the correctness of the BPMN semantics:
  * Check that the gateway branching and joining nodes match (use a dedicated graph analysis phase, not in the parser)
* Saw some youtuber who talks about generating BPMNs via ChatGPT. I guess I should write him when the tool is in a more usable state, then he can evaluate that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StqnUeWv6Lc
* Check whether t0033.bpmd can be fixed or is too weird a situation.
* Add `Edge::is_detached`: For DF edges which will be directly routed (TODO direct routing check should include that it does not add intersections with other edges of the same node). They should ideally only leave or enter at the edges, as this will be the least interruptive? But not sure about this.
* pe-bpmn MPC should be able to be in multiple pools, or at least in multiple lanes. And then specify multiple admins.
* pe-bpmn data_already_protected is not used anywhere, yet.
* pe-bpmn TEEs could be in a cyclic dependency of being each other's admin. This is currently reported as an error but in principle is solvable.

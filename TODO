* g0013.bpmd is a IXI example.
* Add more checks for the correctness of the BPMN semantics:
  * Check that the gateway branching and joining nodes match (use a dedicated graph analysis phase, not in the parser)
* fix the doc/test/build.sh to use Make (or Rust threadpools) so we can have bounded parallelism.
* g0001 or better t0027: Maybe need to add more spacing so that the gateway node arrow heads are not so weirdly tightly bent?


* Saw some youtuber who talks about generating BPMNs via ChatGPT. I guess I should write him when the tool is in a more usable state, then he can evaluate that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StqnUeWv6Lc

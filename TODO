* to_xml: actually export boundary events. Right now arrows are nicely attached, but the boundary event bubble/circle is not drawn.
* Documentation.
* In the crossing minimization, make a tiny factor to favor gateway branch orderings as they were specified in the file, ie. on `NodeId`.
* The port ordering sort by key function is wrong, I messed up the conceptual port ordering then things loop up/left to another pool. It should be the same as the right part of that pool, no distinction between left and right.
* fix the doc/test/build.sh to use Make/parallel (or Rust threadpools) so we can have bounded parallelism.
* Also handle JXI routing: swap up-down order to down-up order (or vice versa), or if it is unavoidable then move JXIs the the IXI handling. (JXI is an edge cross where only one side (top or bottom) has the same y coordinate)
* Add more checks for the correctness of the BPMN semantics:
  * Check that the gateway branching and joining nodes match (use a dedicated graph analysis phase, not in the parser)
* Saw some youtuber who talks about generating BPMNs via ChatGPT. I guess I should write him when the tool is in a more usable state, then he can evaluate that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StqnUeWv6Lc
* Check whether t0033.bpmd can be fixed or is too weird a situation.

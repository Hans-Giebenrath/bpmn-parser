* a joining gateway node does not need to have a matching branching gateway node
* We need automatic leftof constraints for nodes without direct edges:
  Robot's "Move to Material" and "Check Material Weight" should be in one line.
  Without an additional "leftof" constraint the latter one would be placed under the first one.
